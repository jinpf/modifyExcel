#ModifyExcel *(Handle boring homework in a programing way.)*
This is a GUI program written in java.

##How it started?
In a boring class,teacher ask us to mark the weibo data to predict who probably commit suicide.This marking job is all by hand...So we got fucking 600 weibo data to mark,and this weibo may contain the fucking "sad words"...

These data all being recorded in a Excel like this:

So I write a simple tool to help me get this out.

##Remain to do...
Because my time is very limited,my supervisor ask my to do a lot of jobs,so maybe I don\`t have time to fix it up.But this may help it working better.

*  Add a file chooser.So you can choose where to load and to save the file.
*  To complete the random function,so it can realy random and near the answer... *(In fact,I guess the teacher may not see it,oh,it\`s not good..)*
*  In fact,the answer is not in random,so it\`s more complex to analyze the real answer.
